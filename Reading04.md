- What makes your product special?
- How often does your site need to be updated? ie News, Fashion, Reviews

Once you have who is coming and why next you'll want to layout what your site should look like

start out wiht a general site map of where you want all the information to be and go
then create a wireframe ensuring you have all the information you need where it should be. Wireframes do not include themes, fonts, or pictures. Just a basic outline of what the webpage will look like.

Now that you have the basic shape of the site, start to plan what information you want to direct the viewer in. By a good design you can shift the attention of a viewer one way or another. Because Viewers often skim pages you can make the page easier to navigate and get your key message across accurately.

Use Size, Color, and Style to create your visual hierarchy while maintaing a visual balance making your point accurate and understandable.

Use grouping to keep related elements together making navigation and keeping viewers looking.

Clear and concise site navigation will make it easier to navigate and more visually appealing. Viewers should be able to guess what is on the page before clicking the link. Use single descriptive words. Make navigation interactive, it's easy to know where you are and where you are going.
