# CSS and HTML

CSS add style to your barebones site that only had HTML. By using CSS you can customize and tweak your site exactly how you want it. Drawing the eye to your message and site theme.

There are many codes to CSS but a basic one will be:

```
h1, p, footer {
    font-family: Arial;
    font-color: green;
}
```

This will apply the Arial font in the color green to your text in the h1, p, and footer tags from your html tags. Use this to apply similar themes across different pages and parts of each page.

you can link multiple CSS style sheets to each html page to copy similar themes but make unique changes per page!

a basic link tag in html will look like:
```
<link href="css/style.css" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet" />
```
