## :trophy: Growth Mindset 

Growth mindset to me is the ability to get back up when knocked down from a difficult challenge, and continue to try and overcome it

### I can keep a positive attitude and a growth mindset by:
- Know that everyone has to start somewhere
- Stay positive in my abilites and keep trying
- Ask for help, reach out to others to expand my own point of view
