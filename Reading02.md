# Text Editors! Terminals! Oh My!

### What you should know about text editors

A text editor is a key tool used to creating code. Did you know you're own pc has a built in text editor? That's right! If you use Windows the "Notepad" is a very barebones text editing tool you can use to create a website. Although you can get creating right now, it's not the most recommened tool that you can utilize. There are many extra tools you can use to make coding easier. Many 3rd party editors will have Syntax highlighting so you can quickly seperate your text from your code. Another useful tool is Code Completion that will give you suggested code as you type to finish your string for you. Not only does it make is quicker to code but also helps avoid typos and errors that manual input can create!
